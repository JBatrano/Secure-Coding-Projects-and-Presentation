# Secure-Coding-Projects-and-Presentation
Overview
This repository contains the work completed for my Secure Software Development course. The focus of this class was to integrate security best practices into C++ programming, ensuring that software is robust, resilient, and protected against common vulnerabilities.

Contents
Secure Coding Activities:
A series of coding exercises in C++ where secure coding practices were applied. These activities covered a range of topics including input validation, buffer overflow prevention, memory management, and secure authentication.

Coding Standards Presentation:
A detailed presentation on secure coding standards. This presentation outlines the importance of adopting secure coding practices from the beginning of the software development lifecycle, highlighting key standards and their implementation.

Secure Coding Policy:
A comprehensive security policy document developed during the course. This policy includes guidelines and best practices for secure coding in C++, emphasizing the adoption of a "security-first" approach in every phase of development.

Key Concepts
Adoption of Secure Coding Standards:
Emphasizes the importance of integrating security measures at the outset of development rather than as an afterthought. The secure coding standards presented in this repository serve as a foundation for developing secure C++ applications.

Risk Evaluation and Mitigation:
Highlights the importance of evaluating and assessing the risk of vulnerabilities versus the cost of mitigation. The activities in this repository showcase how to implement security controls effectively, balancing risk management with development efficiency.

Zero Trust Architecture:
Demonstrates the application of Zero Trust principles in coding practices, where no entity—internal or external—is inherently trusted. This approach ensures that all aspects of the system are continuously verified and secured.

Security Policies Implementation:
Details the creation and application of security policies that govern coding practices. These policies are designed to ensure that all code written adheres to high security standards, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and enhancing overall system security.

Conclusion
This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of the secure coding practices and principles learned and applied throughout the course. By adopting these practices, the development process becomes more secure, ensuring that the resulting software is both robust and resilient to threats.
